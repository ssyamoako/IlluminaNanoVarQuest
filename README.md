# A snakemake pipeline for variant calling from _P. falciparum_ short amplicon reads
### Motivation
_PS: "The pipeline is currently in the beta stage."_



We sequenced an Illumina sequencing library on the Oxford Nanopore MinION (ONT) to evaluate the cost of this approach.
- PCR amplicons from _Plasmodium falciparum_ drug resistance markers (_ama1, k13, dhps, dhfr and mdr1_) were generated in duplicate.
- Illumina sequencing libraries were generated using KAPA reagents and KAPA indexes.
- Finally, ONT sequence libraries were generated using just one set of ONT adapters and sequenced on the ONT using the R9.4.1 Flow Cell.
- Hence, we cannot demultiplex the sequences into individual samples; further analyses were done at the population level.

### Below are the project dependencies:

#### &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Package management
- [conda](https://conda.io/projects/conda/en/latest/user-guide/install/index.html) - an open-source package management system and environment management system that runs on various platforms, including Windows, MacOS, Linux.

#### &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Workflow management
- [snakemake](https://anaconda.org/bioconda/snakemake) - a workflow management system that aims to reduce the complexity of creating workflows by providing a fast and comfortable execution environment, together with a clean and modern specification language in python style.


#### &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Bioinformatics tools (packages)
- [fastqc](https://anaconda.org/bioconda/fastqc) - a tool for a quality control tool for high throughput sequence data
- [multiqc](https://anaconda.org/bioconda/multiqc) - a tool for aggregating bioinformatics analysis reports across many samples and tools
- [porechop](https://anaconda.org/bioconda/porechop) - a tool for finding and removing adapters from Oxford Nanopore reads. Adapters on the ends of reads are trimmed off, and when a read has an adapter in its middle, it is treated as chimeric and chopped into separate reads. Porechop performs thorough alignments to effectively find adapters, even at low sequence identity.
- [cutadapt](https://anaconda.org/bioconda/cutadapt) - at tool that finds and removes adapter sequences, primers, poly-A tails and other types of unwanted sequence from your high-throughput sequencing reads.
- [bwa](https://anaconda.org/bioconda/bwa) - an aligner for short-read alignment (see [_minimap2_](https://anaconda.org/bioconda/minimap2) for long-read alignment)
- [bedtools](https://anaconda.org/bioconda/bedtools) - allows one to intersect, merge, count, complement, and shuffle genomic intervals from multiple files in widely-used genomic file formats such as BAM, BED, GFF/GTF, VCF
- [bcftools](https://anaconda.org/bioconda/bcftools) - a set of utilities that manipulate variant calls in the Variant Call Format (VCF) and its binary counterpart BCF.
- [snpEff](https://anaconda.org/bioconda/snpeff) - a genetic variant annotation and effect prediction toolbox
- [SnpSift](https://anaconda.org/bioconda/snpsift) - a toolbox that allows you to filter and manipulate annotated files.

### Running the analysis
Install [conda](https://conda.io/projects/conda/en/latest/user-guide/install/index.html) and execute the following commands:

1 - Create the conda analysis environment and install the dependencies from the ***env/environment.yml*** by running the following command in your terminal:
  - `conda env create --file env/environment.yml`
  
2 - Activate the conda environment:
  - _**PS** - This needs to be done every time you want to execute this pipeline_:
  - `conda activate ampseq-analysis`
  
3 - Create the `snpEff` database by executing the bash script below. This script will download *P. falciparum* genome files from PlasmoDB and create and a **snpEff** database:
  - _**PS** - for this analysis, we will use genome data **release-51** from [PlasmoDB](https://plasmodb.org/plasmo/app), and we only need to run it once_:
  - `bash workflow/scripts/create_snpeff_db.sh`

4 - Finally, execute the whole `Snakemake` pipeline by running the following command in your terminal:
  - _**PS** - Replace **4** in the command with the number of CPUs you wish to use_
  - `snakemake -c4`
  
5 - Alternatively, you can execute a specific rule by running the following command in your terminal:
  - _**PS** - Replace **rule** in the command with respective rule-name from the `workflow/Snakefile`_
  - `snakemake -c4 rule` (_for example_ `snakemake -c4 qc_raw_files`)
